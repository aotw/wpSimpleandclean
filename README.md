A basic Wordpress theme built on Wordpress 3.0.

### Contributors


KioshiBlack - various css fixes


## Timeline / Roadmap

* `9/30`  Updated Navbar 
* `10/7`  Updated Sidebar
* `10/14` Fix header text/ admin menu


## TODO

* Style Navbar
* Style Sidebar
* Fix Header text/image problem
* Optimize & organize css (will be a while before I get to this)

## Notes

* Unfortunately my knowledge of php is slim so I can only do so much, as I learn php while in the process of coding this theme. Theres and issue with the H1 in the header. In the wordpress options, changing the text color doesnt make any changes on the actual theme,  you would have to go to style.css to set the color yourself.
